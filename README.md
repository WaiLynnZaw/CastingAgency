# Casting Agency

## Full Stack Nanodegree - Final Project

For the final projects, I decided to head start on the Casting Agency Project Idea.
With python-flask app for backend and React Frontend, using Auth0 as the auth service.

Brief:
The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process.

1. Assistant can view the movies and actors
2. Director can view, modify and delete the actors and can view and modify the movies
3. Producer can view, modify and delete the actors and movies
